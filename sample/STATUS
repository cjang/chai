Note: All GPUs are tested with a headless Intel Core i7 920 host running
      Ubuntu 9.10 x86_64 (2.6.31-14) and the following vendor versions:
      - AMD APP SDK 2.6 with Catalyst driver 11.12
      - Intel OpenCL SDK 1.5
      - NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 3.1 with driver 256.40

Note: Failures due to vendor OpenCL shader compiler hangs and segmentation
      faults are not included. The work around for this is auto-tuning
      ahead-of-time (desirable in any case). Auto-tuning AOT allows the
      good kernels to be learned before the application runs. That way,
      the JIT compiler does not encounter bad kernels just-in-time.

Not really failures:

OK - everything works
AF - autotuning fails for batched kernels, scheduled to interpreter
IR - interpreter support only (compute device RNG not implemented)
IS - interpreter support only (single precision only compute device)

Definitely failures:

OF - everything works except may fail rarely (enough to be noticed?)
SV - segmentation fault (also bus error)
KF - segmentation fault in kernel generated by shader compiler
UC - usually correct results, sometimes wrong
UW - results generally wrong or out of order
